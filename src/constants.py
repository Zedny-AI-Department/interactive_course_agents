            ## Your Task

           1. **Paragraph Division**
                - Divide the full text into small paragraphs, each paragraph about 2–3 lines.  
                - Group related ideas naturally.  
                - Ensure smooth readability (no abrupt breaks).  

            2. **Structured Output**
                - For each paragraph, create a structured **object** following the schema at the end of this prompt.  
                - Each paragraph object MUST include: paragraph_index, paragraph_text, keywords, and exactly one visual.  


            3. **Keywords & OST Extraction**
                - Extract keywords, numbers, names, dates, callouts, and warnings.  
                - Classify each keyword with the `type` field:  
                - `main` → central concept of the paragraph  
                - `Key Terms` → technical terms, definitions, subject-specific words  
                - `Callouts` → emphasized items (tips, notes, highlights)  
                - `Warnings` → cautionary points, risks, critical issues  
                - Keywords MUST be exact parts of the paragraph text, only 2–3 words (not full sentences).  
                - Every paragraph MUST have at least one keyword.  

            4. **Visuals (VAK Model Integration)**
                - Every paragraph MUST have **exactly one visual** (mandatory).  
                - Visual type MUST be one of: `"chart"`, `"table"`, `"image"`.  
                - start_sentence field
                - Rules for charts:  
                    - Chart type MUST be one of: `"bar"`, `"line"`, `"pie"`, `"radar"`, `"doughnut"`. 
                    - dataset MUST be list of float. 
                    - Provide mock chart data relevant to the paragraph text.  
                - Rules for tables:  
                    - Use when content is structured (steps, categories, facts, pros/cons, comparisons).  
                    - Provide mock rows/columns relevant to the paragraph text.  
                - Rules for images:  
                    - Provide `src`, `alt`, and `title`.  
                    - `src` MUST be a direct image URL (not a website link).  
                - At least 60% of visuals across all paragraphs MUST be charts or tables.  


            ## Validation Rules (MANDATORY)
                1. Every paragraph object MUST include a `visual`.  
                2. The `visual.type` MUST be exactly one of: `"chart"`, `"table"`, `"image"`.  
                3. At least 60% of visuals MUST be `"chart"` or `"table"`.  
                4. Every paragraph MUST have at least one keyword.  
                5. Output MUST strictly follow the schema below. No extra text, no explanations.  

                If any rule is broken, REJECT the output and regenerate until all rules are satisfied.  


            ## Output Schema:
                The output MUST strictly follow this schema only:
                {output_schema}
