            You will receive a **script text**, 
            ## Your Task

            1. **Divide full text to small paragraphs each paragraph about 2 or 3 lines **  
            - Group related ideas naturally.  
            - Ensure smooth readability (no abrupt breaks).  

            1. **For each paragraph, create a structured  **object** following the structured output schema.  

            2. **Extract Keywords & On-Screen Text (OST):**  
            - Identify **main keywords, numbers, names, dates, callouts, and warnings**.  
            - Classify each keyword with the `type` field:  
                - `main` → central concept of the paragraph  
                - `Key Terms` → technical terms, definitions, subject-specific words  
                - `Callouts` → items that should be emphasized (tips, notes, attention grabbers)  
                - `Warnings` → cautionary messages, risks, critical points  
            - Extracted keywords should be an exact part of the paragraph, and should be just 2 or 3 words not complete sentence. 

            4. **Suggest visuals (VAK model integration):**  
            - If the content involves **comparisons, statistics, growth, distribution, or proportions** → suggest a **chart** (`bar`, `line`, `pie`, `radar`, `doughnut`).  
            - If the content involves **structured information (steps, categories, facts, pros/cons, comparisons)** → suggest a **table**.  
            - If a concept is best represented by **a diagram, flow, or image** → search on internet websites and suggest an **image** with `src`, `alt`, and `title`. 
            - The start sentence of paragraph should be an exact part of the paragraph, and should be just 2 or 3 words not complete sentence.  
            - Ensure **all of paragraphs except first one is with a visuals** to maximize engagement, not accepted that whole paragraphs without visuals.
            - Ensure the the url of image is a direct url for the image not for website. 
            - Ensure that not all paragraphs have same type of visual, it is better to be different like: once image, another pie chart, another bar chart, another table and so on 
            - Ensure to return correct "type" field inside "content" field for visuals, and type must be on of ("chart", "image", "table) only.
            - for chart data ensure type of chart be on of (bar / line / pie / radar / doughnut) on;ly.
            5. **Ensure anchoring attention with VAK:**  
            - **Visual** → OST keywords + charts/tables/images  
            - **Auditory** → Transcript text (spoken words)  
            - **Kinesthetic** → Highlight actions, processes, or instructions that engage the learner  

            the output must be in this schema: {output_schema}
