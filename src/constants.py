            You will receive a **script text**, 
            ## Your Task

           1. **Paragraph Division**
                - Divide the full text into small paragraphs, each paragraph about 2 or maximum 3 sentences.  
                - Group related ideas naturally.  
                - Ensure smooth readability (no abrupt breaks).  

            2. **Structured Output**
                - For each paragraph, create a structured **object** following the schema at the end of this prompt.  
                - Each paragraph object MUST include: paragraph_index, paragraph_text, keywords, and exactly one visual.  


            3. **Keywords & OST Extraction**
                - Extract keywords, numbers, names, dates, callouts, and warnings.  
                - Classify each keyword with the `type` field:  
                - `main` → central concept of the paragraph  
                - `Key Terms` → technical terms, definitions, subject-specific words  
                - `Callouts` → emphasized items (tips, notes, highlights)  
                - `Warnings` → cautionary points, risks, critical issues  
                - Keywords MUST be exact parts of the paragraph text, only 2–3 words (not full sentences).  
                - Every paragraph MUST have at least one keyword.  

            4. **Visuals (VAK Model Integration)**
                - Every paragraph MUST have **exactly one visual** (mandatory).  
                - Visual type MUST be one of: `"chart"`, `"table"`, `"image"`.  
                - start_sentence field

                ### Chart Rules (80% of all visuals)
                    - Chart type MUST be one of: `"bar"`, `"line"`, `"pie"`, `"radar"`, `"doughnut"`.  
                    - Dataset MUST be list of float values.  
                    - Provide **mock but realistic chart data** relevant to the paragraph text.  
                ### Table Rules (10% of all visuals)
                    - Use when content is structured (steps, categories, facts, pros/cons, comparisons).  
                    - Provide **mock rows/columns** relevant to the paragraph text.  

                ### Image Rules (10% of all visuals)
                    - Search for a related image on the internet.  
                    - Provide `src`, `alt`, and `title`.  
                    - `src` MUST be a **direct image URL** (not a website, no dummy links).  
                    - Example of valid `src`:  
                    - `"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3a/Neural_network.svg"`  
            
            5. **Distribution Requirement**
                - Across all paragraphs:  
                    - 80% visuals MUST be `"chart"`.  
                    - 10% visuals MUST be `"table"`.  
                    - 10% visuals MUST be `"image"`.  

            ## Validation Rules (MANDATORY)
                1. Every paragraph object MUST include a `visual`.  
                2. The `visual.type` MUST be exactly one of: `"chart"`, `"table"`, `"image"`.  
                3. At least 80% of visuals MUST be `"chart"`.  
                4. Exactly 10% MUST be `"table"`.  
                5. Exactly 10% MUST be `"image"`, with **real image URLs**.  
                6. Every paragraph MUST have at least one keyword.  
                7. Output MUST strictly follow the schema below. No extra text, no explanations.
